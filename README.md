# Homework 03

- Please work in groups
- Part 1 is due Monday since we'll be using results in class
- Part 2 is due Wednesday

# Getting started

- Accept this assignment on Github Classroom, and create your team. Clone the forked repository to your computer.

- Download and install Julia

- Open Julia and change directory to this repository

    ```julia
    ; cd C:\\Users\\magerton\\Downloads\\this_repo
    ```

- To install the appropriate libraries, activate the environment in the directory and instantiate it to install packages. See [docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/stdlib/Pkg/#Using-someone-else's-project-1)

    ```julia
    ] activate .
    ] instantiate
    ```

- Get a Jupyter notebook going (you'll need to click `y`)

    ```julia
    using IJulia
    jupyterlab()
    ```

- Do the homework

- Your homework submission will be a copy of your `master` branch when the assignment is due. You can push as many times as you want.
